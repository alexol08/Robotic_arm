This is the first stage in making my robotic arms for my goal of making a robotic arm that can be a lab technician.
I hope that this coupled along with future AGI/ASI can mean that automated research can be done in chemistry and biology.
Hopefully, with a system smarter than us, it will be able to find the cure to diseases and help people in their daily lives.

I studied coordinate transformations, FK, IK generally as well as homogenous transformations to do this. 
I opted to use geometry instead for v1 - this uses the law of cosines to discover each servo required angle. 
I wanted a good amount of rotation and that is why in my model - 90 degrees is when the arm is straight (converntionaly 0 degrees)
